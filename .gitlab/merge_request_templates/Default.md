Make sure all these requirements are met:

- [ ] ALREADY READ README
- [ ] Hooks are not missing any dependencies
- [ ] Add all `Trans`, `t` for texts
- [ ] Not use `any` for type, if any, explain in the comment
- [ ] Use `clsx` to concat classes
- [ ] Use react-query for fetching data, not useState + useEffect
- [ ] Create `index.tsx`/`index.ts` when needed: there are many files, index to export all of them; pages have many sub pages
