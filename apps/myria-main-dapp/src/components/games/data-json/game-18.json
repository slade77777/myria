          "It all starts with our EverydaySHEROE book series for children of all ages. By representing strong females in these stories, we're setting the stage for a more inclusive Metaverse game that everyone can enjoy. These books will show children that they can be anything they want to be when they grow up. And while the Metaverse P2E game will be open to players of all genders, a story is a foundation for any good game, and the Metaverse is no different. By creating a world full of inspirational role models, we can help players feel more connected to the game and its characters. This, in turn, will make the game more enjoyable and  immersive overall. In short, stories are what make a good Metaverse game great. "
