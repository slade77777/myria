The game presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, constant danger and action, immense PvP and PvE battles and a thriving player economy in an ever-expanding sandbox. The game will allow users to fly smoothly from deep space to 5 unique planetary surfaces without any loading screens, and explore an infinite procedurally generated galaxy. The Animera game utilizes “gacha” mechanics, meaning players earn in-game currency (or pay) in order to earn things like spaceships, weapons and rare NFT items.",
